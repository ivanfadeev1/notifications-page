## Overview

Responsive notifications page featuring different types of messages, counter and 'mark all as read' button.

The button is clickable and toggles the state of the counter and messages.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
